# WhatsApp Bot Architecture

This document describes the modular architecture of the WhatsApp Bot with Smart Wallet functionality.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The bot is built with a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct layers:

### Services Layer (`/services/`)

#### ConnectionManager.js
- **Purpose**: Manages WhatsApp client connection, authentication, and disconnection
- **Responsibilities**:
  - WhatsApp client initialization and configuration
  - QR code generation and handling
  - Authentication state management
  - Connection/disconnection logic
  - Session management
  - Authorization checks

#### WalletService.js
- **Purpose**: Handles all wallet-related operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Local wallet simulation
  - Balance management
  - Transaction tracking
  - Fund transfers between wallets
  - Transaction history

#### BlockchainService.js
- **Purpose**: Manages interactions with the blockchain server
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User registration with blockchain server
  - Profile management
  - Payment processing
  - Health checks
  - API communication

### Handlers Layer (`/handlers/`)

#### MessageHandler.js
- **Purpose**: Processes incoming WhatsApp messages and commands
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Message parsing and routing
  - Command execution
  - Response generation
  - Error handling
  - User interaction logic

### Routes Layer (`/routes/`)

#### ApiRoutes.js
- **Purpose**: Defines all API endpoints
- **Responsibilities**:
  - REST API endpoints
  - Request/response handling
  - Authentication checks
  - Error responses

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**: WhatsApp messages are received by the ConnectionManager
2. **Message Processing**: Messages are passed to MessageHandler for processing
3. **Service Interaction**: MessageHandler interacts with WalletService and BlockchainService as needed
4. **Response Generation**: Responses are generated and sent back through the ConnectionManager
5. **API Requests**: External API requests are handled by ApiRoutes and routed to appropriate services

## 🎯 Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Clear boundaries between different layers
- Minimal coupling between components

### Dependency Injection
- Services are injected where needed
- Easy to mock for testing
- Loose coupling between components

### Maintainability
- Each file has a focused purpose
- Changes to one component don't affect others
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality

### Testability
- Each module can be tested independently
- Clear interfaces between components
- Easy to mock dependencies

### Scalability
- Easy to add new features
- Simple to extend existing functionality
- Clear patterns for new developers

## 🔧 Key Components

### Main Server (server.js)
- Orchestrates all components
- Sets up Express server and Socket.IO
- Initializes all services
- Handles graceful shutdown

### ConnectionManager
- Manages WhatsApp Web client lifecycle
- Handles authentication and session management
- Provides real-time status updates
- Manages QR code generation

### WalletService
- Simulates wallet operations
- Tracks user balances and transactions
- Handles fund transfers
- Maintains transaction history

### BlockchainService
- Interfaces with external blockchain server
- Handles user registration and authentication
- Manages blockchain-based operations
- Provides health monitoring

### MessageHandler
- Processes all incoming messages
- Implements command system
- Generates user-friendly responses
- Handles error cases gracefully

### ApiRoutes
- Exposes REST API endpoints
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Implements authentication and authorization
- Provides system status and health checks

## 🚀 Benefits

### For Developers
- **Clear Structure**: Easy to understand and navigate
- **Focused Development**: Work on one component at a time
- **Better Testing**: Test components in isolation
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues are isolated to specific modules

### For Maintenance
- **Modular Updates**: Update components independently
- **Reduced Risk**: Changes don't affect unrelated functionality
- **Better Documentation**: Each module is self-contained
- **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the structure quickly

### For Scalability
- **Add New Features**: Extend existing modules or add new ones
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize specific components
- **Technology Migration**: Replace individual components
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features:

- **Database Service**: Add persistent storage
- **Logging Service**: Centralized logging and monitoring
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications and alerts
- **Analytics Service**: Usage tracking and analytics
- **Security Service**: Enhanced authentication and authorization
- **Integration Service**: Connect with external APIs

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust, maintainable, and scalable WhatsApp bot with smart wallet functionality.
